Each entity will get an applicable range existing of 2 columns StartTime and EndTime.
For each entity in the database we set the unique identifier to
    ID + StartTime

We never update any existing records. Instead we make a copy of it. We set the EndTime of the existing record to `now`
and set the startTime of the copy to `now` as well. We leave the EndTime of the new record as `NULL`

`NULL` has a well defined meaning for applicable ranges. There can only be one entry with a Null on the EndTime. This will
be considered the current active one.

For a single entity there should never be any entries with overlapping applicable range and the same ID.

Deleting can be achieved by setting the EndTime of the current active record
